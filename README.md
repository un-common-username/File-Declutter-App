# File-Declutter-App
This python script uses the os module to traverse through all directories and sub directories specified under a root directory and removes all the unwanted filetypes. The program can recursively traverse through all directories under one directory.  

Edit: This is edited to remove all the subtitle files, because they were all of the wrong language.
